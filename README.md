Hi! I'm Eric Hartmann and I have a pretty diverse IT background, allow me to take you on a tour and let me show you how I can help you.

I have been developing on and off for over 15 years now. My most recent projects include React.js, the MEAN stack, jquery mobile, node.js, AngularJS, and several other technologies (see resume)
I have completed IT projects as a Developer, Project Manager, Business Analyst, and a QA Engineer, so I know what it takes to make a project successful and come in under time and under budget.
Currently my career goals are to work in the field of development and learn as much as possible about new technologies and deliver a lot of value.
